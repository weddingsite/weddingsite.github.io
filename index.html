					<header><h2>Our Story</h2></header>
					<p> Ali and Jason first met in high school, and they got to know each other
					when they both took AP Music Theory. Sadly, they never dated back then, 
					and Jason's attempt to ask Ali to prom was thwarted. But luckily, their 
					amazing group of friends continued to get together long after they had gone 
					their separate ways for college. They first kissed after driving home from
					a group trip to the Minnesota Renaissance Festival (which is now tradition),
					and after much deliberation about the prospect of dating long distance,
					they officially began dating on December 3rd, 2009. Since then,
					they've been on many exciting adventures...</p>

					<header><h2>Her Story</h2></header>
					<p style="font-size:85%"> I knew something was up when we were getting ready to go out to dinner the 
					night of our 4 year anniversary and suddenly Jason declared that he had no
					black socks, and so he must immediately run to Target, and then bolted out
					the door. It was quite un-Jason-like, so I was pretty suspicious, but also really hungry for dinner.
					Dinner, as it turned out, was at this lovely restaurant called Forepaugh's in St Paul,
					and we got through the meal without any surprises, so I started to think that 
					all of my suspicions were for naught. But then the dessert menu came, and
					Jason told me not to order because he had other plans for desssert.
					But, before dessert, he asked if I would like to go explore the upstairs of the restaurant
					(which is apparently a haunted house). I'm a sucker for 19th century 
					architecture, so we went upstairs to explore. I was investigating the upper
					landing when Jason informed me that he had an important question that he had
					been meaning to ask, and my heart jumped, of course. But then
				       	he told me that he'd been 
					designing a website and he wanted to ask what I thought. I had thought
					he was teasing, so I punched him. However, he actually did have a website
					on his phone that he wanted me to see, and on the bottom was a sweet
					little message and the words "Will you marry me?" and I burst into tears
					as soon as I saw him get down on one knee. After we calmed down, we called
					our parents, cried more, and then we went to dessert, which turned out to
					be Perkins and our friends were there! We celebrated with tears, hugs, and pie. 
					Also, it turned out the website he showed me on his phone was this one:
					jasonandali.aretotallygettingmarried.com! So we've re-vamped it to be
					our wedding website!</p>

					<header><h2>His Story</h2></header>
					<p style="font-size:85%">Okay, so here's the thing about the socks. There was a mix-up with the
					jewelry store, so they didn't have the ring ready when I went to get it that
					morning. They said they'd try to get it sorted out as soon as possible,
					but I had to get home and get ready for dinner. Then, just before I got
					home, they called and said that it was ready sooner than expected! So I had
					to come up with a way to go pick it up without Ali noticing. I ran through
					a bunch of plans in my head... I could just propose as we headed out the door,
					and say that we needed to go get the ring, I could blindfold her and say
					that the restaurant was a surprise, and then make a "pit stop"... Ultimately,
					I settled on the socks. In fairness, I legitimately only had one black sock
					in my drawer, so it wasn't a total lie.</p>

					<p style="font-size:85%">At that point, I hadn't quite started the ball rolling, so I had a decision
					to make &mdash; propose tonight, or delay it? With the ring ending up getting 
					finished early, I decided that all signs pointed to yes. I had already asked
					her parents' permission, so I called my parents to let them know and sent a
					text to our friends to tell them and ask them out to Perkins for dessert.
					The whole thing was fairly improvised. I had put together the website and my
					note, but other than that, I didn't have a firm plan. I thought about asking
					early on in the dinner, so that she could be excited about it, but it just
					never ended up feeling right. When we overheard the table next to us talking
					to their server about exploring the house/restaurant, it all clicked into place.
					It's a good thing I waited, because I don't know if we could have made it
					through dinner otherwise. We dashed off to Perkins, calling our parents
					along the way, and we were treated to some complimentary pies &mdash; a 
					perfect end to the night.</p>

					<p> Ali's younger sister, Kendra, may be enjoying her college life in Wisconsin, but she did graduate from Minnetonka High School, so she is trustworthy. While it's hard to have Kendra away for the wedding planning, she is avidly Pinning to the wedding board on Pinterest, and supportively Skyping from afar. Kendra enjoys long walks on the beach and flannel shirts, among other things.</p>
